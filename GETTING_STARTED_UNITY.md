  - Scroll = zoom
  - Middle-click + drag = pan

**Game View (Center, next to Scene)**
- What the player sees
- Switch to this tab when in Play Mode

**Inspector (Right)**
- Shows properties of selected object
- This is where you adjust settings

**Project (Bottom)**
- All your files and assets
- Navigate to `Assets/_Project/` to see our code

**Console (Bottom)**
- Shows messages and errors
- Click to open: **Window ‚Üí General ‚Üí Console**

## Common Beginner Issues

### "I don't see anything when I press Play"
- Make sure you have a Camera in the scene
- Check camera position is not inside the terrain
- Look at Game View tab (not Scene View)

### "Console shows errors"
- Read the error message carefully
- Often just missing references - we'll fix these as we build

### "Play button is grayed out"
- Unity is still compiling code
- Wait for the spinner in bottom-right to stop

### "Scene is empty/black"
- You might need to create the environment
- Run: Community ‚Üí Setup ‚Üí Create Festival Environment

### "I can't find the Community menu"
- Make sure all scripts compiled successfully
- Check Console for any red errors
- Try: Assets ‚Üí Reimport All
